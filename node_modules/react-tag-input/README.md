React-tags is a simple tagging component ready to drop in your React projects. The component is inspired by GMail's *To* field in the compose window.

### Features
- Autocomplete based on a suggestion list
- Keyboard friendly and mouse support
- Reorder tags using drag and drop

### Why
Because I was looking for an excuse to build a standalone component and publish it in the wild? To be honest, I needed a tagging component that provided the above features for my [React-Surveyman](http://github.com/prakhar1989/react-surveyman) project. Since I was unable to find one which met my requirements (and the fact that I generally enjoy re-inventing the wheel) this is what I came up with.


### Demo

Check it out [here](http://prakhar.me/react-tags/example)

### Installation
The preferred way of using the component is via NPM

```
npm install --save react-tag-input
```
It is, however, also available to be used separately (`dist/ReactTags.min.js`). If you prefer this method remember to include [ReactDND](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd) as a dependancy. Refer to the [demo](http://prakhar.me/react-tags/example) to see how this works.

### Usage

Here's a sample implementation that initializes the component with a list of initial `tags` and `suggestions` list. Apart from this, there are multiple events, handlers for which need to be set. For more details, go through the [API](#Options).

You can also play with live code on [WebpackBin](http://www.webpackbin.com/41DVgMvv-).

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { WithContext as ReactTags } from 'react-tag-input';

const App = React.createClass({
    getInitialState() {
        return {
            tags: [ {id: 1, text: "Apples"} ],
            suggestions: ["Banana", "Mango", "Pear", "Apricot"]
        }
    },
    handleDelete(i) {
        let tags = this.state.tags;
        tags.splice(i, 1);
        this.setState({tags: tags});
    },
    handleAddition(tag) {
        let tags = this.state.tags;
        tags.push({
            id: tags.length + 1,
            text: tag
        });
        this.setState({tags: tags});
    },
    handleDrag(tag, currPos, newPos) {
        let tags = this.state.tags;

        // mutate array
        tags.splice(currPos, 1);
        tags.splice(newPos, 0, tag);

        // re-render
        this.setState({ tags: tags });
    },
    render() {
        let tags = this.state.tags;
        let suggestions = this.state.suggestions;
        return (
            <div>
                <ReactTags tags={tags}
                    suggestions={suggestions}
                    handleDelete={this.handleDelete}
                    handleAddition={this.handleAddition}
                    handleDrag={this.handleDrag} />
            </div>
        )
    }
});

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

**A note about `Contexts`**
One of the dependencies of this component is the [react-dnd](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd) library. Since the 1.0 version, the original author has changed the API and requires the application using any draggable components to have a top-level [backend](http://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/docs-html5-backend.html) context. So if you're using this component in an existing Application that uses React-DND you will already have a backend defined, in which case, you should `require` the component *without* the context.

```javascript
const ReactTags = require('react-tag-input').WithOutContext;
```
Otherwise, you can simply import along with the backend itself (as shown above). If you have ideas to make this API better, I'd [love to hear](https://github.com/prakhar1989/react-tags/issues/new).

<a name="tagsOption"></a>
##### tags (optional)
An array of tags that are displayed as pre-selected. Each tag should have an `id` and a `text` property which is used to display.

```js
let tags =  [ {id: 1, text: "Apples"} ]
```

<a name="suggestionsOption"></a>
##### suggestions (optional)
An array of suggestions that are used as basis for showing suggestions. At the moment, this should be an array of strings.

```js
let suggestions = ["mango", "pineapple", "orange", "pear"];
```

<a name="delimiters"></a>
##### delimiters (optional)
Specifies which characters should terminate tags input (default: enter and tab). A list of character codes.


<a name="placeholderOption"></a>
##### placeholder (optional)
The placeholder shown for the input. Defaults to `Add new tag`.

```
let placeholder = "Add new country"
```

<a name="labelFieldOption"></a>
##### labelField (optional)
Provide an alternative `label` property for the tags. Defaults to `text`.

```
<ReactTags tags={tags}
    suggestions={}
    labelField={'name'}
    handleDrag={} />
```
This is useful if your data uses the `text` property for something else.


<a name="handleAdditionOption"></a>
##### handleAddition (required)
Function called when the user wants to add a tag (either a click, a tab press or carriage return)

```js
function(tag) {
    // add the tag to the tag list
}
```

<a name="handleDeleteOption"></a>
##### handleDelete (required)
Function called when the user wants to delete a tag

```js
function(i) {
    // delete the tag at index i
}
```

<a name="handleDragOption"></a>
##### handleDrag (optional)
If you want tags to be draggable, you need to provide this function.
Function called when the user drags a tag.

```js
function(tag, currPos, newPos) {
    // remove tag from currPos and add in newPos
}
```

<a name="handleFilterSuggestions"></a>
##### handleFilterSuggestions (optional)
To assert control over the suggestions filter, you may contribute a function that is executed whenever a filtered set
of suggestions is expected. By default, the text input value will be matched against each suggestion, and [those that
**start with** the entered text][default-suggestions-filter-logic] will be included in the filters suggestions list. If you do contribute a custom filter
function, you must return an array of suggestions. Please do not mutate the passed suggestions array.

For example, if you prefer to override the default filter behavior and instead match any suggestions that contain
the entered text _anywhere_ in the suggestion, your `handleFilterSuggestions` property may look like this:

```js
function(textInputValue, possibleSuggestionsArray) {
    var lowerCaseQuery = textInputValue.toLowerCase()

    return possibleSuggestionsArray.filter(function(suggestion)  {
        return suggestion.toLowerCase().includes(lowerCaseQuery)
    })
}
```

Note: The above custom filter uses `String.prototype.includes`, which was added to JavaScript as part of the ECMAScript 7
specification. If you need to support a browser that does not yet include support for this method, you will need to
either refactor the above filter based on the capabilities of your supported browsers, or import a [polyfill for
`String.prototype.includes`][includes-polyfill].

<a name="autofocus"></a>
##### autofocus (optional)
Optional boolean param to control whether the text-input should be autofocused on mount.

```js
<ReactTags
    autofocus={false}
    ...>        
```

<a name="allowDeleteFromEmptyInput"></a>
##### allowDeleteFromEmptyInput (optional)
Optional boolean param to control whether tags should be deleted when the 'Delete' key is pressed in an empty Input Box.

```js
<ReactTags
    allowDeleteFromEmptyInput={false}
    ...>
```

<a name="handleInputChange"></a>
##### handleInputChange (optional)
Optional event handler for input onChange

```js
<ReactTags
    handleInputChange={this.handleInputChange}
    ...>
```

<a name="handleInputBlur"></a>
##### handleInputBlur (optional)
Optional event handler for input onBlur

```js
<ReactTags
    handleInputBlur={this.handleInputBlur}
    ...>
```

<a name="minQueryLength"></a>
##### minQueryLength (optional)
How many characters are needed for suggestions to appear (default: 2).

<a name="removeComponent"></a>
##### removeComponent (optional)
If you'd like to supply your own tag delete/remove element, create a React component and pass it as a property to ReactTags using the `removeComponent` option. By default, a simple anchor link with an "x" text node as its only child is rendered, but if you'd like to, say, replace this with a `<button>` element that uses an image instead of text, your markup may look something like this:

```javascript
import {WithContext as ReactTags} from 'react-tag-input'

class Foo extends React.Component {
   render() {
      return <ReactTags removeComponent={RemoveComponent}/>
   }
}

class RemoveComponent extends React.Component {
   render() {
      return (
         <button {...this.props}>
            <img src="my-icon.png" />
         </button>
      )
   }
}
```

The "ReactTags__remove" className and `onClick` handler properties can be automatically included on the `<button>` by using the [JSX spread attribute](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-spread.html), as illustrated above.

<a name="autocomplete"></a>
##### autocomplete (optional)
Useful for enhancing data entry workflows for your users by ensuring the first matching suggestion is automatically converted to a tag when a [delimiter](#delimiters) key is pressed (such as the enter key). This option has three possible values:

- `true` - when delimeter key (such as enter) is pressed, first matching suggestion is used.
- `1` - when delimeter key (such as enter) is pressed, matching suggestion is used only if there is a single matching suggestion
- `false` (default) - tags are not autocompleted on enter/delimiter

This option has no effect if there are no [`suggestions`](#suggestionsOption).

<a name="readOnly"></a>
##### readOnly (optional)
Renders the component in read-only mode without the input box and `removeComponent`. This also disables the drag-n-drop feature.

### Styling
`<ReactTags>` does not come up with any styles. However, it is very easy to customize the look of the component the way you want it. By default, the component provides the following classes with which you can style -

- `ReactTags__tags`
- `ReactTags__tagInput`
- `ReactTags__tagInputField`
- `ReactTags__selected`
- `ReactTags__selected ReactTags__tag`
- `ReactTags__selected ReactTags__remove`
- `ReactTags__suggestions`

An example can be found in `/example/reactTags.css`.

If you need to set your own class names on the component, you may pass in
a `classNames` prop.

```js
  <ReactTags
    classNames={{
      tags: 'tagsClass',
      tagInput: 'tagInputClass',
      tagInputField: 'tagInputFieldClass',
      selected: 'selectedClass',
      tag: 'tagClass',
      remove: 'removeClass',
      suggestions: 'suggestionsClass'
    }}
    ...>
```


### Dev
The component is written in ES6 and uses [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) as its build tool.
```
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:8090/example/index.html
```

### Thanks
The autocomplete dropdown is inspired by Lea Verou's [awesomeplete](https://github.com/LeaVerou/awesomplete) library. The Drag and drop functionality is provided by Dan Abramov's insanely useful [ReactDND](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd) library.

Also thanks to the awesome contributors who've made the library far better!
